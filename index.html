      <p>
        Welcome to <span>Little Einsteins Academy.</span> We are a new and exciting childcare
        establishment that caters to a large age range from birth to 8 years. Our staff can provide
        a safe and stimulating environment with plenty of opportunity to explore, learn and
        discover. We are located in Blackwood and more information about this can be found by
        clicking the buttons above.<br /><br />

        At <span>Little Einsteins</span> we are proud to offer an extensive range of facilities.
        Just some of the amenities we are equipped with include a self contained baby unit, sensory
        room, large spacious play areas and additional features for out of school care.  We
        understand that children love the outdoors and we have accommodated for this with a large
        and secure outdoor play area with safety flooring. As well as this we have planned future
        development in our own private woodland which is set to include an adventure play area,
        nature trail, story-telling area and sensory garden.<br /><br />

        Of course your little ones are our top priority; however we have also thought about you. At
        the back of the premises there is a private parking zone that can be used for drop-off and
        collection.  The car park is positioned close to the reception area for convenience.
