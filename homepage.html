  <p>Welcome to <span class="important">Little Einsteins Academy.</span> We are a new and exciting        childcare establishment that caters to a large age range from birth to 8 years. Our staff can provide     a safe and stimulating environment with plenty of opportunity to explore, learn and discover. We are      located in Blackwood and more information about this can be found by clicking the buttons        above.<br><br>

  At <span class="important">Little Einsteins</span> we are proud to offer an extensive range of        facilities. Just some of the amenities we are equipped with include a self contained baby unit,        sensory room, large spacious play areas and additional features for out of school care. We understand     that children love the outdoors and we have accommodated for this with a large and secure outdoor play    area with safety flooring. As well as this we have planned future development in our own private        woodland which is set to include an adventure play area, nature trail, story-telling area and sensory     garden.<br><br>

  Of course your little ones are our top priority; however we have also thought about you. At the back      of the premises there is a private parking zone that can be used for drop-off and collection. The car     park is positioned close to the reception area for convenience.</p><br>
